Analysis: The user's request and chat history indicate the need for a UI HTML form to schedule a meeting. The form should allow the user to specify the meeting details such as time, duration, agenda, and participants. An enhanced UI form using Tailwind CSS would benefit the interaction by providing a structured and visually appealing way to gather this information.

Requirements: True

Current Focus: Creating a UI HTML form to schedule a meeting with specified details.

Observation:
The form must include input fields for the meeting time, duration, agenda, and a multi-select for participants. It should be user-friendly and visually consistent.

Thought:
The form will be designed to collect all necessary information in a clear and organized manner. Each component will be tailored to the user's needs and will follow UI design principles.

Key Details:
- Contacts: ['Anmol', 'Sukrit', 'Rahul', 'Riya', 'Sakshi', 'Rohan']
- Free slots: ['10AM-11AM', '11AM-12PM', '12PM-1PM', '2PM-3PM', '3PM-4PM', '4PM-5PM']

Component breakdown:
- [ ] Component 1 (Meeting Time Dropdown): --HTML-- Construct a dropdown menu for selecting the meeting time from the provided free slots. --Tailwind-- Style the dropdown with a width that fits the form, padding for comfort, a border for definition, and a font that's easy to read. --JS-- Use JavaScript to populate the dropdown options with the free slots.
- [ ] Component 2 (Duration Input): --HTML-- Create an input field for the user to specify the meeting duration. --Tailwind-- Style the input field with responsive width, padding, border, and font size for readability. --JS-- Implement validation to ensure the input is a valid time duration.
- [ ] Component 3 (Agenda Textarea): --HTML-- Add a textarea for the meeting agenda. --Tailwind-- Style the textarea with sufficient height and width, padding, and a border. Ensure the font is legible and the box is resizable. --JS-- Optionally, add character count validation.
- [ ] Component 4 (Participants Multi-select): --HTML-- Create a multi-select field for choosing participants from the contacts list. --Tailwind-- Style the multi-select to match the form's design, with a clear indication of selected options. --JS-- Populate the multi-select with the contacts and handle the selection logic.
- [ ] Component 5 (Submit Button): --HTML-- Add a submit button for the user to submit the form. --Tailwind-- Style the submit button to be visually prominent and consistent with the form's design. Use padding, font size, color, background, and border properties, with transitions for hover effects. --JS-- Attach event listeners to handle form submission and validation.
