Analysis: The user's request and chat history indicate that they are looking for assistance in designing a poster for a music concert featuring a band called 'The Rockers'. The assistant's clarifying question about whether to add images or text to the poster suggests that a UI HTML form could be beneficial for collecting specific details about the poster design. This form would allow the user to specify their preferences for the poster, such as the inclusion of images, text, and other design elements.

Current Focus: The primary objective is to create a UI HTML form that allows the user to input details for a custom concert poster design.

The form should be intuitive and guide the user through the process of specifying the details for their poster design. Each component should be designed to collect specific information in a user-friendly manner.

Key Details:
- The concert is for a band called 'The Rockers'.
- The poster is for a rock concert.
- The user may want to add images or text to the poster.

Component breakdown:
