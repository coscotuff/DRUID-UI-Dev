Analysis: The user's request and chat history indicate the need for scheduling a meeting, which involves selecting a time slot, defining an agenda, and choosing participants. A renderable UI HTML form would enhance this interaction by providing a structured and user-friendly way to gather all necessary information.

Requirements: True

Current Focus: Creating a UI HTML form to schedule a meeting.

Observation:
The form must allow the user to select a time slot, define the meeting agenda, and choose participants from a predefined list.

Thought:
The form should be intuitive and guide the user through the process of scheduling a meeting step by step. Each component should be designed to ensure a smooth user experience.

Key Details:
- Time slots available: ['10-11 AM', '11-12 PM', '12PM-1PM', '2PM-3PM', '3PM-4PM', '4PM-5PM']
- Participants available: ['Anmol', 'Sukrit', 'Rahul', 'Riya', 'Sakshi', 'Rohan']

Component breakdown:
- [ ] Component 1 (Time Slot Dropdown): --HTML-- Create a dropdown menu for selecting the meeting time slot. --CSS-- Style the dropdown to match the form's aesthetic, with custom arrow indicators and hover effects. --JS-- Use JavaScript to populate the dropdown with the available time slots and handle the user's selection.
