# Chat Color Picker UI

This project implements an intuitive and visually appealing color picker designed specifically for a chat interface.

## Usage

To use this feature, simply select your desired background colour using the colour picker input. Once you have chosen your preferred colour, click on "Apply Colour". The new colour will be shown in real-time on an example of a typical chat interface component.

## Technical Considerations

The front-end implementation uses standard HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript without any additional libraries or frameworks. It is designed with responsiveness in mind so that it adapts smoothly across various devices and screen sizes.

For future maintenance or updates:

- Ensure compatibility with all modern browsers by conducting cross-browser testing regularly.
- Collaborate closely with back-end developers when integrating into existing systems so that user preferences are saved correctly.

### Note:

The actual saving of user-selected colours requires back-end functionality which has not been implemented here due to scope limitations. Please consult your back-end team for integration details.
